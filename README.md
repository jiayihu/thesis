**The language of the document is Italian for the time being.**

The document is the final report of my work during the internship in WorkWave Italy, for the Bachelor Degree in Computer Science.

The purpose of the project has been experimenting with the latest web technologies about multi-window web applications. For this purpose there has been the need to do first a period of Research & Development, testing the state of art of multi-window in JavaScript ed integrate the solutions in WorkWave Route Manager. The latter is an application which allows customers to plan, track and analyze the real-time routes of their vehicles.

To be specific, the goal was extracting React components from the web application as separate windows, but with the state synched. This has allowed the Route manager to show its Google Maps map, rich of essential information, in a full-screen separate monitor.

The project has been named **Stargate**, inspired from the sci-fi tv series.

Both Stargate and Route Manager are built with Typescript 3.0, React 16 and Redux 4.
